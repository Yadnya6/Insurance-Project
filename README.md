## KPI's Overview and Features 

1. Number of invoice by account executive

![](Insurance_KPI_1.jpg)

It is reported that we can see that ﻿At 71, Divya Dhingra had the highest Count of invoice_number and was 7,000.00% higher than Neel Jain, which had the lowest Count of invoice_number at 1.

suggestions to improve the invoices thus increase in sales:
- Review and optimize your internal processes for creating, sending, and managing invoices 
- Implement efficient workflow systems and automation tools to reduce manual work and minimize errors
- Invest in marketing and sales efforts to attract new clients
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns, establish partnerships with brokers or agents, and offer competitive packages to draw in more customers

2. Yearly Meeting Count

![](Insurance_KPI_2.jpg)

We observed varying levels of meeting activity among our account executives. Some held a higher number of meetings, while others had a more moderate approach.

The most noticeable change is the substantial increase in the number of meetings from 2019 to 2020, rising from 3 to 31. This dramatic rise could be attributed to several factors. Such as:
- Business expansion: 
It’s possible that our company experienced growth during this period, necessitating more frequent meetings to manage increased operations and activities
- Market Dynamics: 
The global business landscape might have seen rapid changes, requiring more regular discussions  and adjustments to our strategies
- Technology Adoption: 
Embracing new technologies or digital platforms could have made it easier and more efficient to conduct meetings, prompting more frequent interactions

3. Cross Sell--Target,Achive,new

![](Insurance_KPI_3.jpg)

After analyzing the data we can see that the target given for the revenue generation for each executive is achieved in cross sell and renewal fields respectively.
But the given revenue target for generating new leads is not achieved by some of the executive. Hence we need to analyze the data further and rectify the issue in generating new leads.
